[].	Support recompile of base classes during reload
	Figure out how to not have any files in the repo locked by Revit. This means that the loader needs to generate
	a new temp dll for baseclasses and also for ScriptExecutor. So on every reload a new version of this dll is
	generated and the C# source code needs to know which dll to load SE from.
	Main loader still needs a script executor and output window. So there would be a little code duplication.
