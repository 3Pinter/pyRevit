# pyRevit for Autodesk RevitÂ®

[Browse to pyRevit blog to learn more and download the installation.](http://eirannejad.github.io/pyRevit/)

- In it's simplest form, it's a folder of IronPython `.py` scripts for Autodesk Revit.
- There is also an IronPython helper script, named `__init__.py`, that creates a ribbon tab and creates UI buttons for the IronPython scripts at Revit startup. Adding a button to this tab is as easy as adding a IronPython script file to the pyRevit folder and reloading pyRevit. 

## Branches

Branches in this repository are used for features, development, and different components of the pyRevit library. Here is a quick explanation on the purpose for each branch:

####Master Branches:

The setup program clones these two branches into your machine at installation.

-	`master` : Master branch holds the main published repository. (It's currently empty but will hold the library scripts for final release of version 3.) It also includes this Readme file that provides a link to the [pyRevit blog](http://eirannejad.github.io/pyRevit/).
- `loader` : This is the main branch for the loader script that creates UI buttons for the library scripts. It also includes the compiled `.dll` binaries for `RevitPythonLoader` that is needed to create the buttons.

####Develop Branches:

- `verThreeDev` : This is the beta version code for the pyRevit library. The current beta installer, clones this branch to your machine. This will be pulled to master for the final version.

####Misc Branches:

- `gh-pages` : The source for [pyRevit blog](http://eirannejad.github.io/pyRevit/).
