# pyRevit for Autodesk Revit®

[Browse to pyRevit blog to learn more and download the installation.](http://eirannejad.github.io/pyRevit/)

- In it's simplest form, it's a folder of IronPython `.py` scripts for Autodesk Revit.
- There is also an IronPython helper script, named `__init__.py`, that creates a ribbon tab and creates UI buttons for the IronPython scripts at Revit startup. Adding a button to this tab is as easy as adding a IronPython script file to the pyRevit folder and reloading pyRevit. 

####Main Branches:

The setup program clones these two branches into your machine at installation.
